/**
 * The Deployer interface describes how to deploy manually controlled {@link Deployment}'s during test execution. 
 * <p>
 * By default {@link Deployment}'s are managed by Arquillian, which mean Arquillian will perform the deploy and undeploy 
 * operations for you automatically in the background. In some cases you might want a more fine grained control over the
 * deployment lifecycle. e.g. You might need to test some kind of auto discovery feature of your application that happens during startup? 
 * In this case you can define a {@link Deployment} to not be {@link Deployment#managed()} = false and
 * use the Deployer to manually deploy and undeploy them at your own will.
 * <p>
 * Usage Example:<br/>
 * <pre><code>
 * &#64;Deployment(name = "X", managed = false)
 * public static WebArchive create() {
 *      return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class);
 * }
 *
 * &#64;ArquillianResource
 * private Deployer deployer;
 *
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldDeployX() {
 *      deployer.deploy("X");
 * }
 * </code></pre>
