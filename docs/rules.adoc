=== Rules
:icons: font

If you want to use Arquillian Testing Platform with other JUnit Runner, you can now use JUnit Rules - `ArquillianTestClass` and `ArquillianTest` - and happily let Arquillian do the heavy lifting for your tests.

To get the similar functionality what the `@RunWith(Arquillian.class)` is offering you should require both rules i.e. `ArquillianTestClass` and `ArquillianTest`. If you are trying to run tests with one rule, it will fail by saying "Arquillian needs both rules to get full functionality."

==== How to use it?

[source, java, indent=0]
----
public class GreeterManagedBeanWithJUnitRulesTestCase {

    @ClassRule
    public static ArquillianTestClass arquillianTestClass = new ArquillianTestClass();

    @Rule
    public ArquillianTest arquillianTest = new ArquillianTest();

    @Deployment
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
            .addClass(Greeter.class)
            .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
    }

    @Inject
    Greeter greeter;

    @Test
    public void should_greet_earthlings() throws Exception {
        String name = "Earthlings";
        Assert.assertEquals("Hello, " + name, greeter.greet(name));
    }

}

IMPORTANT: However while using above Junit Rules you can't inject method scoped Arquillian resources.
Unfortunately it is not possible to have one rule acting as both test class and test method rule. For more info
 see this https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/351#issuecomment-102084524[comment].
In order to use any other JUnit Method Rule with `ArquillianTest` Rule, you have to use it with `RuleChain`
having `ArquillianTest` as outer Rule.
e.g.
```java
   @Rule
   public MethodRule testWatchman = MethodRuleChain.outer(new ArquillianTest().around(new TestWatchman());
```
