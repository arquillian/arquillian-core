=== Getting Started

We promised that integration and functional testing with Arquillian is
no more complex than writing a unit test. Now it's time to prove it to
you. We've prepared a series of guides designed exclusively to teach you
how to use Arquillian. You'll have the tests running from both Maven and
Eclipse by the end of the first guide.

Head over to the http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started[Getting
Started Guide] and start writing real tests!
