=== Deployment Archives
:icons: font

Each Arquillian test is associated with at least one deployment. The
deployment is configured using a static method annotated with
`@Deployment` that returns a ShrinkWrap archive. Here's an example:

[source,java]
----
@Deployment
public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
    return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
        .addClass(Greeter.class)
        .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
}
----

_Why is a deployment necessary?_

If we want to be able to test inside the container, we need some way to
get the code into the container. A container typically accepts some form
of deployment. In most Java-based containers, these deployments are some
sort of Java archive (jar).

ShrinkWrap provides a way to define a deployment archive (e.g., jar,
war, ear) in Java using a fluent API. You use this API to create an
deployment that's associated with the test case, which we call a "micro
deployment". Arquillian can then use this object to stream the contents
to the server in the most efficient way available.

The deployment archive is more than just a means to an end (getting code
inside the container). There are several critical benefits to defining a
deployment:

.  It allows you to isolate the classpath of the test â€“ only those
classes and resources inside the deployment are visible to the test.
.  You can emulate or replicate a deployment scenario, which often
triggers behavior (e.g., framework activation) that you cannot otherwise
test.
.  We can skip the build. Since the archive is assembled in Java, we're
able to leverage the incremental compilation provided by IDEs.

In summary, the strategy of using ShrinkWrap-based deployments gives you
tremendous control over the code you're testing and quicker turnaround.

NOTE: Arquillian provides the SPI
`org.jboss.arquillian.spi.client.deployment.DeploymentScenarioGenerator`
to allow an alternate means of defining a deployment, including
foregoing the use of a deployment altogether.

=== Deployment Archives using Java SPI

In <<Deployment Archives>> you've read how to create an archive to deploy into container using `@Deployment` annotation.
But you can implement your own method to generate the archive to be deployed using a Java SPI `org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.spi.client.deployment.AutomaticDeployment`.

The service must conform next signature:

```
include::../container/test-spi/src/main/java/org/jboss/arquillian/container/test/spi/client/deployment/AutomaticDeployment.java[tag=docs, indent=0]
```

TIP: To build `DeploymentConfiguration` type you can use `org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.api.DeploymentConfiguration.DeploymentContentBuilder` class.

IMPORTANT: Remember to register the SPI by creating `META-INF/services/org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.spi.client.deployment.AutomaticDeployment` file containing the fully qualified name of your implementation.

Moreover, you can use `@BeforeDeployment` method annotation which allows you to modify the archive before it is deployed.
The method must be public static and receive as a parameter an `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive` which is the archive created by `AutomaticDeployment` implementation and return a modified `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive`.

[source, java]
----
@BeforeDeployment
public static Archive addDeploymentContent(Archive archive) {
    // Modify Archive
    return archive;
}
